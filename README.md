# PigGame
A game to play with your friend.
Made with Java Script.
The first player that get 100 points win!
Roll the dice and collect points, when you feel like it's enough press hold and save the points. BUT BE AWARE!
If you roll a 1, you lose all your points and it switches over to the second player. So play smart!
